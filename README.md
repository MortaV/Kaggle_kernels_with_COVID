# The purpose

This directory is used to store notebook for Udacity Data Scientist nanodegree.

The task was to choose a dataset and to answer 3 questions related to it and write a blog post about it on Medium.

# Summary results

I chose Kaggle Meta data dataset with a putpose to check if social distancing is changing our habits on Kaggle. I analyzed 3 things:
* number of kernels, datasets and votes on them;
* number of kernels and datasets related to COVID vs. the rest;
* difference in votes between COVID vs. the rest.

I found ot that the activity on Kaggle is increasing and that a third of new kernels and a half of new datasets are related to COVID-19. COVID-19 kernels are also getting more "love" - people are voting on them more.

# Data
